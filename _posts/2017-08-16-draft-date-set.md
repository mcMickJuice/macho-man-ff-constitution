After much hand wringing, arm twisting and jokes about "the art of the deal" and handjobs, the league has settled on a draft date:

<div class="callout">September 4th (Labor Day) at 8pm CST</div> 

Remember that keepers need to be selected 24 hours in advance. No exceptions.  The past couple of years, it seems that half of the league has ignored this rule and has either wanted to change their keeper selection or select their keeper last minute. Those of us responsible and respectful enough to have set their keepers in advance have complained that I have unfairly accommodated these slackers.  Therefore, I have decided that I am going to enact a zero tolerance policy: 

<div class="callout">
If you don't select your keeper 24 hours in advance, you do not get a keeper.</div>

Some (Zach) might call the above stance draconian or authoritarian.  Well those people can suck a dick.

The draft order is the inverse order of last year's standings, with the champion (Nick) getting the 12th pick:

1. Team DankingData
2. Luby's Legends Lube
3. Spider 2 Y Banana Threat
4. Going Bald(win)
5. Locker Room Talk
6. Pack Lives Matter
7. Who Art Thou
8. Team Bobarino
9. Large Lacy Lingerie
10. Fitz Rawl About The Benjamins
11. Shirtless Vince McMahon
12. Shirtless Angela Merkel

Remember that we have some rules around which players you can keep and what round you lose based on your keeper selection.  To review these rules, <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/league/keeper">click here</a>.

As always, please arrive about 15 minutes early so that we can iron out any technical difficulties and have everyone ready to go when the clock strikes 8.

Thanks and let's make this year's Macho Man fantasy football madness the best and safest ever!
