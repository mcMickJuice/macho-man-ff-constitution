			Only one team can hold the championship belt at a given time

			If the holder of the belt wins his head to head game, he keeps the belt. If he loses, his opponent gets control of the belt.</li>
		<li>
			The team who has the belt at the end of the year gets a payout (this is TBD) and is the holder for the following year.
		</li>
		<li>
			The belt can change hands in both the regular season AND in the postseason (championship bracket AND toilet bowl)
		</li>
