		Starting this year, we will be replacing weekly high team score payouts with a different system. Inspired by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/"
		 target="_blank">r/nfl</a> and their concept of the <a href="https://www.playoffmagic.com/nfl/title-belt/" target="_blank">NFL title belt</a>,
		we will be implementing a title belt
		<span>(disclosure: not an actual title belt)</span> that can change hands from week to week.
	</p>
	<p>
		Much like WWE/WWF/WCW wrestling, if the holder of the belt wins, they keep the belt. If they lose, the challenger assumes
		the title of holder. However, there are a couple more nuances specific to our league and payouts. These rules are
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
			Only one team can hold the championship belt at a given time
		</li>
		<li>
			If the holder of the belt wins his head to head game, he keeps the belt. If he loses, his opponent gets control of the belt.</li>
		<li>
			Week 7 is the <span>Intercontinental Title Match</span>, where the winner of that week (i.e. the holder of the belt after
			week 7) wins $50
		</li>
		<li>
			The belt can change hands in both the regular season AND in the postseason (championship bracket AND toilet bowl). This means
			that the belt holder at the end of the year will be either the League Champion or Toilet Bowl Champion
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		One small wrinkle in all this is the final belt holder payout. It is likely that the holder of the belt at the end of the
		regular season (week 13) will have qualified for the playoffs. Since the belt can change hands in the playoffs, the league
		champion will also be the belt holder at the end of the year. This would result in the final belt payout to (almost) always
		be paid out to the league champion. In an effort to separate the two, the following rules will apply to the final belt
		payout:

	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			If the holder of the belt after week 13 qualifies for the playoffs, they will win the end of year belt payout of $80.
		</li>
		<li>
			If the holder of the belt after week 13 does not make the playoffs, the belt payout will be paid to the winner of the toilet
			bowl
		</li>
		<li>
			In both scenarios, the belt is still active and the winner of the bracket in which the belt is active will be the belt holder
			entering the following year.
		</li>
	</ul>
