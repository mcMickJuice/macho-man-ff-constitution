## Mission Statement

To play fantasy football which inevitably results in stressing about a “sport” that is completely nonsense but at the same time, utterly essential to our sanity.

## General Rules

Size of League – 12 Owners, split up into 3 divisions.

Playoff Weeks – Week 14 – Week 16

Draft Rules – Thou shalt participate in a Snake Draft in reverse order of previous year’s final standings (including championship), 2 minutes per pick first 8 rounds, 1 minute per pick thereafter.  Owners lose the round of keeper that they selected from previous year (i.e. Hakeem Nicks in Round 4 in 2010 would result in the loss of 2011 Round 4 pick).  Owners must arrive to the live draft 30 minutes prior to the start of the draft.  Owners joining online must be in the draft room 10 minutes prior.  THERE WILL BE ABSOLUTELY NO CALLING IN OF PICKS. YOU MUST BE EITHER PRESENT IN THE ROOM FOR THE DRAFT OR IN THE DRAFT ROOM ONLINE TO PARTICIPATE THIS YEAR.  No going to Fuddruckers with your family instead of attending the draft.
Draft Pick Trading is allowed but subject to league approval

Keepers – Owners have the option to keep 1 player from the previous year and will lose the round from the previous year (specified above).  Any player drafted after the 8th round or picked up in FA (where the FA was undrafted) will lose an 8th round pick.  Keepers may be traded prior to the draft and all keeper picks must be submitted 1 week prior to the draft date, no exceptions.  You do not have to keep a player. For more information on keepers, see here: [Keeper Rules]: /league/keeper

## Rosters

Roster Size – max 17 players

Waiver Wire System – Free Agency Bidding

Minimum bid amount - $1

Budget per team - $100

Overview - bids on FA after a week of games process on Wednesday morning (6am).  Bids on dropped players process 3 days after player is dropped.  After bids process, all FAs are available at anytime and for free.  In the event that there is a tie on bid amount, the team with the lower record gets the player.  You cannot trade salary cap space.

## Trades

Votes to veto a trade – 6 (simple majority of league)

Number of days to veto a trade – 2 (trade then processes the next day unless it goes through after all rosters lock)

Penalty for bullshit trade offers –scolding of team owner by the commissioner

Trade deadline – Week 11 (negotiable, irrelevant)

Penalty for collusion – BANISHMENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

## Scoring system

[ESPN standard scoring](http://games.espn.com/ffl/resources/help/content?name=scoring-settings-standard)
except for the following exceptions

Passing TDs - 6 points

Reception - 1 point

Yardage, TD bonuses - no bonuses

Defensive points - no negative points for points scored against

Defensive yards - no point bonuses for yards allowed

*please note that punt or kickoff returns for touchdowns DO NOT count towards an individual players stats (so when Mike Martin or Sam Barcelona drafts Devin Hester and start bitching when he runs one back but they don’t get a points, we can laugh at them and tell them that, not only is Devin Hester just OK as an all-around football player, but that it’s laughable that the Bear’s best player is a special teamer -- Note this sentence was written in 2010 but is included in constitution for preservation)

Point system: whole integers, no decimal

Event in a tie – team with more bench points wins

Event that starters and benches tie – Bank loses, because this will only ever happen to Bank

Overall negative points for a player – No

## League Format

Head-to-head, 3, 4 team divisions

Schedule – determined at random by the league where each team plays their divisional foes twice

Playoffs – Division winners automatically advance, with the remaining 3 teams with the best record rounding out the rest of the playoff bracket

Byes - Two division winners with best records receive a bye.

Tiebreakers – In the event of a tiebreaker, the following conditions apply in sequence from 1st to last:

Head-to-head

Total points for

It’ll never come down to this but, total points against
