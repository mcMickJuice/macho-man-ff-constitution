title: Keeper Rules
---

<div>
	<p>
		Heres an overview of the keeper rules that have been in place for at least 5 years
	</p>
	<p class="important">
		IMPORTANT: Keep in mind that the first round of ESPN's fantasy drafts for keeper leagues is the selection of each team's
		keeper. So effectively the first "real" round of the draft will appear as <b>Round 2</b> in the draft app. For the following
		rules, when I say <b>Round 1</b> or
		<b>First Round</b>, I'm not talking about the Keeper Round, I'm talking about the real First Round.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Keepers need to be in a day before the draft
		</li>
		<li>You don't need to keep a player</li>
		<li>
			Keepers can be selected by going to your team page and clicking the "Select Keepers" link
			<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/keeper-selection.png" alt="Where to select keeper">
		</li>
		<li>
			If you keep a player, you lose a round above where he was selected last year. E.g. If you picked Ryan Tannehill in the 6th
			round last year, you would lose a 5th rounder this year.
		</li>
		<li>
			You can't keep a player you selected in the first round last year, nor can you keep a keeper that you kept last year if they
			were projected to go in the first round last year.
		</li>
		<li>
			If your keeper is someone you got off of the waiver wire and was not drafted, you lose your 8th round pick. If they were
			drafted (regardless of if you drafted them or not) the pick lost is based on that draft position.
		</li>
		<li>
			The lowest draft pick you would lose is the 8th round. Therefore, if you kept a keeper you selected in the 9th round last
			year, you would lose your 8th rounder this year. If you keep a 13th rounder from last year, you lose your 8th round this
			year.
		</li>
	</ul>

		<h3>Where Can I find last year's draft results?</h3>
		<p>

			Last year's draft picks can be found by going to last years page, clicking the "More" dropdown from the subnav and Selecting
			"Draft Recap". I cant link directly to the draft recap but heres last years league page -
			<a target="_blank" href="http://games.espn.com/ffl/leagueoffice?leagueId=94664&seasonId=2015">Results</a>
