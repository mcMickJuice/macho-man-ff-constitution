            <h4>Purpose</h4>
            <p>
                Every year, without fail, the following questions are asked:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>What are the keeper rules?</li>
                <li>Where can I find last year's draft results?</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h4>Keeper Rules</h4>
            <p>
                Heres an overview of the keeper rules that have been in place for at least 5 years
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Keepers need to be in a day before the draft
                </li>
                <li>
                    Keepers can be selected by going to your team page and clicking the "Select Keepers" link
                    <img src="./assets/keeper-selection.png" alt="Where to select keeper">
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you keep a player, you lose a round above where he was selected last year. E.g. If you picked Ryan Tannehill in the 6th
                    round last year, you would lose a 5th rounder this year.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You can't keep a player you selected in the first round last year, nor can you keep a keeper that you kept last year if they
                    were projected to go in the first round last year.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The lowest draft pick you would lose is the 8th round. Therefore, if you kept a keeper you selected in the 9th round last
                    year, you would lose your 8th rounder this year. If you keep a 13th rounder from last year, you lose
                    your 8th round this year.
                </li>

            <h4>Where Can I find last year's draft results</h4>
            <p>

                Last year's draft picks can be found by going to last years page, clicking the "More" dropdown from the subnav and Selecting
                "Draft Recap". I cant link directly to the draft recap but heres last years league page -
